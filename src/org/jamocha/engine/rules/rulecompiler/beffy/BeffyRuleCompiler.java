/**
 * @author Josef Alexander Hahn
 * We have the old SlimFast-RuleCompiler, which is buggy and not that
 * feature-rich. Furthermore, it sometimes compiles wrong rete-nets :(
 * 
 * So, we urgently need a successor... Due to the fact that there are
 * unsolved technical questions for writing a perfect rule compiler, the
 * plan is to write one, which handles its task as good as my knowledge
 * allows it. This will hopefully lead to this BeffyRuleCompiler (beffy
 * as nice abbreviation for "Best EFFort").
 * 
 * As you can see at many places in the code: This rule compiler is 
 * _NOT_ optimized for memory-usage, for the speed of rule-compiling
 * or the size of the resulting rete network. At many places,
 * my code makes redundant things. In exchange, the code is more readable,
 * more understandable and more powerful than the old one, since with 
 * efficiency in mind, it wouldn't be possible for me to implement all
 * the features :-p
 *
