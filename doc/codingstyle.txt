Javadoc:
 - All comments (everything but @param) start with a capital letter
 - only @param comments start with a lower case letter.
 - All comments (not @author) end with a ".".
 - @author tags should look like "Christoph Terwelp <christoph.terwelp@rwth-aachen.de>".
 - Links should start with a lower case letter iff the word has the same meaning without the class context.
 - class comments should contain @see tags for all related classes.
